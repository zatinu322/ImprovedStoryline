	<string
		id="8837"
		value="Confirmation of the instant evolution theory||...In the course of my research, I was able to find definitive and credible arguments in favor of the theory of evolutionary leapfrogging, however paradoxical it might be. Most people really could not accept this gift, permanently settled in cities, and still desperately grasping for the crumbs of their former lives.||But there are exceptions. They, who also don't understand what they are up against, try to behave like the most ordinary people, but there is great potential in them themselves. They are the ones who manage to break the shackles of the daily routine, leave their homes, and travel the world.||At first everything seems normal to them, but the more they observe the world from the outside, the stronger their sense of unreality, of the artificiality of what is happening. Then they begin to search for answers, and this search leads them to the Overlord, who takes them for himself forever.||However, the author of this theory was wrong about one thing. No living human could die, no matter what happened to him. After the activation of the device inside the Overlord (as the Madmen call him), time itself stopped existing on this planet, and, therefore, the concept of death underwent strong changes." />

	<string
		id="8838"
		value="Of course, because people still hold the old conceptions of death, a person who dies in front of their eyes will be considered dead by them, but he himself will not die, but, instantly forgetting his death, will continue to do what he was doing before. It is just that other people will stop noticing him.||It is the same with physiological needs. The new people are not hungry, thirsty, hot, cold, suffering from any disease or injury. Yes, they can still freeze from the cold and sweat from the heat and die from supposedly deadly diseases, but it all happens only in their heads according to the same algorithm I described above.||With emotions it is much more complicated. As I was able to find out, the mental state of new people is directly affected by the downed plate. In its immediate surroundings (Vahat and Zarmek), people are excessively aggressive, their minds are clouded, and their thinking is confused. In my opinion, this is explained by the Overlord's defense mechanism, whose main purpose is to protect himself by preventing intruders from entering Zarmek." />

	<string
		id="8839"
		value="On the other side of the fallen plate lie the Mountains of the Wise, with a radically different situation. Whereas in the Desert, the locals force strangers away from the crash site, the peaceful snowy landscapes themselves dispose anyone in the region to abandon all their goals and stay there forever. Very few are able to resist the strange energy of this place, which the locals call the &amp;quot;Grace&amp;quot;. It is, as we see it, a very different mechanism for protecting the Overlord from strangers.||The mind of people in other regions is almost completely unaffected by the Overlord. The reason for this behavior is unknown - either the inhabitants of distant lands pose no danger to him, or he simply cannot influence such long distances.||It is also extremely important to mention the two sides of the conflict surrounding the Overlord. On one side is the Njeri race, to which the Overlord directly belongs. On the other side is an artificial intelligence calling itself the Oracle. Njeri pursue the goal of keeping humanity in check, preventing the final accomplishment of the evolutionary leap mentioned earlier. The Oracle's goal is the complete destruction of the Overlord, which will do more harm than good.||But how can we, ordinary people, get out of this difficult situation? There is only one way out: wait. Waiting for someone who, having learned the whole truth, will not go crazy, will realize his otherness and break free from the shackles of a familiar, but now non-existent life." />
