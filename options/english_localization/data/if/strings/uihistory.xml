		id="r1_Firsy_History_00"
		value="We’ve been taking our vegetables to Sowth’s market for years. I’m not a bad driver, but father never let me go there on my own until today. But today is my birthday: I can do whatever I want! I bet dad is preparing a surprise for me and wants me to be out of his way for now. Well, I'm going to dive into big city life then!" />

	<string
		id="r1_Yes_Lisa_History_01"
		value="I’ve had an unexpected encounter near the town. A good-looking girl asked me to help her. From the way she looked and carried herself, I suspected that she might be involved with a gang, but I agreed: you gotta trust people. There’s no harm in showing her around, is there?" />

	<string
		id="r1_Three_Villages_00"
		value="What was my father going to tell me, I wonder? I’d better be going home now; I’ve stayed here way too long." />

	<string
		id="r1_First_Felix_Meet_00"
		value="Damn bandits! They don't let you feel safe anywhere. Luckily, my truck may be old, but it's still very solid! I defeated Felix's bandits, but for some reason their threats of make me pay for it got under my skin." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Gloohoe_To_Ben_01"
		value="I noticed the smoke over my village from a distance. A terrible thing happened: somebody killed all the people and burnt the village to the ground. Father was on the ground, his strength leaving his body, but before he passed away, he gave me what looked like a birthday gift. His last words were: “Find Ben Throttle”. I buried the dead people and went back to my truck. I opened the box and found dad’s savings, a sparkling object which looked like a disc and a sealed letter with my name on it." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Letter_00"
		value="The letter said I was adopted and my true father was an explorer, called Ivan Go, Explorer. All that’s left from him is the truck I’m driving now and a mysterious disc of unknown utility. Ivan Go has gone missing many years ago and is probably dead by now. My world has just turned upside down. To get my feet back on the ground, I have to find out all about my real father! If he is alive, I will find him wherever he is and find out why he abandoned me. But first I have to talk to Ben Throttle." />

	<string
		id="r1_South_About_Felix_00"
		value="The barman at Sowth told me where I could find Ben Throttle and shared his suspicions that the local thug Felix might have been involved in my father's death. I decided to kill him: not for revenge, but for the safety of others. With the powerful weapons offered by a kind man, I might be able to destroy his lair on my own." />

	<string
		id="r1_Felix_Not_Dead"
		value="The barman at Sowth told me where I could find Ben Throttle and shared his suspicions that the local thug Felix might have been involved in my father's death. But I decided to honor my father's last wish and not avenge his murder, since it is more important to find Ben now." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Ben_00"
		value="I had to travel a lot before I found out anything specific. I didn't realize that there were other towns and villages beyond my homeland. Finally, I was shown the way to Ben's place." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Ben_00"
		value="The old man saw the familiar features in me and gave me a warm welcome. His house was full of strange objects. When I told him my story, he said my father has been gone for over 20 years. He found something important but didn’t want to tell anyone about it until he made sure it was safe. Ben told me a little about my father and his live as Explorer. He also told me that Lisa is his daughter and that she is looking for my father, too. At the end he gave me directions to my father’s house." />

	<string
		id="r1_Kill_Felix_00"
		value="The bandits' base lies in ruins, Felix has fled with his tail between his legs. He wasn't the one responsible for my father's death, so I didn't have the guts to kill him in cold blood. He may be evil, but who am I to be his judge? The men who had destroyed Glukhoe were far more powerful than this pack of scum. I realized it myself when I attacked their hideout, and the leader's words only confirmed my thinking. The only witness to the horrible crime was Lisa, a visitor from the north. Perhaps I should follow her? I'll talk to the bartender about it." />

	<string
		id="r1_Father_Room_00"
		value="If Ben's home seemed strange to me, my father's dwelling was simply breathtaking. To me, though, all the strange contraptions that filled my father's house were just a heap of useless junk. All the machines seemed to be out of order. The humid air that penetrated the house through broken windows and roof is probably the reason. One thing drew my attention – a Charm of unusual shape, which I found in a stash when a board cracked underneath my feet." />

	<string
		id="r1_See_Tonnel_00"
		value="The mercenaries use the tunnel, which starts near Asgard. This is a pretty dangerous place: I bet locals cooperate with the bandits and get their interest from arms traffic." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Tonnel_00"
		value="I got the key to the tunnel door and after several hours’ driving with my headlights on I found myself in a strange new place." />

	<string
		id="r2_Find_Lisa_00"
		value="After my first meeting with the locals, I realized that the people here are far less civilized than my countrymen in Krai. However, I learned an interesting thing from them: that Lisa is Axel’s assistant. Axel is the leader of a gang based in Argen. |The gang is called Crimson Dawn’, and it's a hell of a lot more than just a band of thugs. They’ve declared a war against Librium and that’s just a part of their ambitious plans. I don't think I can get to him alone." />

	<string
		id="r2_SNG_00"
		value="I joined the CIT, the Commonwealth of Independent Towns – that’s what Librium people call themselves. I think that their fight against the invaders is a noble cause. Besides, we have a common enemy. Axel." />

	<string
		id="r2_AM_00"
		value="I joined the ranks of the anti-militarists. It seems to me that their movement against general warfare is a righteous cause. Maybe this way I can even get to Axel without too much violence." />

	<string
		id="r2_AR_00"
		value="The best way to get to Axel is probably to join his Crimson Dawn army. I’ll gain the commander’s respect and get presented for an award. And when I meet Axel in person, he's not going anywhere." />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Axel_00"
		value="That was a hell of a war. It wasn’t always direct, but it was always destructive. And I had to do things I’m probably going to regret. But I don’t have time for that now that Axel is almost in my hands." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Axel_02"
		value="I was bitterly disappointed after I defeated the Crimson Dawn leader. I expected to meet a barbarian, a ruthless killer, but before me stood an intellectual man, concerned about the future of the humankind. And even though I couldn’t accept his methods, I sort of liked him. Especially since it turned out that Lisa kept him in the dark about her actions." />

	<string
		id="r2_With_Lisa_To_Oracul_01"
		value="Lisa told me about her true motives and asked me to take her with me to the Oracle. I felt sorry for her, so I agreed. She told that there is no need to go to the Oracle through the north, and that there is an underwater tunnel guarded by a creature like the one I fought in Hel." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Desert_00"
		value="I obtained all the necessary components, gave them to the Midgard's master, and, after paying for the work, found myself the owner of a machine capable of enduring the hardships of the endless desert." />

	<string
		id="r1_Lisa_Thief_00"
		value="My joy didn’t last. Lisa, an old acquaintance, has stolen both discs and the key to the Sea Gate! Ben told me to look for her in the west. I’ll follow her and ask her why she wants things that have no value to anyone but me." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Boss1"
		value="I never imagined such monsters existed, and today I came face to face with one of them. As it turned out, the way to the Sea Gate was guarded, but I managed to defeat the guard, though a couple of times I thought he was going to crush me." />

	<string
		id="r3_After_WaterGate_1"
		value="When I finally reached the seashore, I immediately spotted the Sea Gate. It was a grand structure at the very edge of the firm ground. I approached it and lifted the Charm above my head, which felt warmer for some reason. The next thing I saw was a giant fish coming to the surface. The fish opened its mouth which looked big enough for two trucks to fit in, and froze as if inviting me to drive in. Terrified, I drove inside… The mouth closed and I heard a loud splash as the monster dived back into the sea depths.|The monster turned out to be a huge mechanism, like my truck." />

	<string
		id="r3_JustGo_1"
		value="The region was truly exotic: huge trees and humid air stirred primal instincts in me." />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Fight_1"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. However, I was not welcomed there with much hospitality, so I had to withdraw with a fight and look for a more friendly settlement.| Luckily, I found it soon enough. The people of the other village gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids." />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_LureDruid"
		value="I didn’t like the idea of an ambush, but I agreed to help the villagers nonetheless. In return for my help, the Machine-cultists showed me the way to the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_NoLureDruid"
		value="I refused to take part in their bloody plan, so I headed towards the forest capital – Seth." />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Friendly"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. However, I was not met there with much hospitality, even though I managed to keep the misunderstanding under control. It turns out that only the High Druid from Seth knows the way to the Oracle, so I set off towards Seth." />

	<string
		id="r3_Set_HelpMainDruid_1"
		value="The High Druid presented me with a difficult task, but a couple of steel monsters couldn't break my determination. I had to travel all over this godforsaken land to earn the old man's trust and find out where the Oracle was." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_FirstTime"
		value="I had imagined a hermit's hut high in the mountains when the Oracle was spoken of, but what I saw was nothing like the stories of wizards and sages. A complex of towers connected by overhead passages, sparkling with dangerous energy, inside was a human-made monster. That’s how I first met the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_HelpHim_1"
		value="The Oracle asked for a favor in return for information. I had no option but to agree." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_DecodeDisc1"
		value="The Oracle agreed to read the disc if I carry out certain assignment for him. Fair enough, I thought. And besides, the island was full of interesting places." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_NeedDisc2"
		value="When the Oracle took the disc from me I froze with anticipation of what might be revealed to me. Imagine my disappointment when an emotionless voice declared: ‘Insert disc #2’! But I only had one! Which I expressed into the small window, punctuating my speech with exclamations and profanity. I couldn’t believe it! Were all my efforts in vain? The Oracle asked me calmly where I got the disc from and what I was trying to find out with its help. He told me to look for the second disc among my father’s things. I think it's time to go to his house again." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_BringDisc2"
		value="With the disc and the Charm in my bag, I visited the Oracle again. My father’s message was finally deciphered! At long last I heard my father’s voice… He was talking about his life and research. Most importantly, I found out that his path was taking him across the desert in search of some important device. It must have been something top secret, since my dad hid his diary so well. I realized that my dad wanted me to hear these words and to know where he was heading, in case he couldn’t come back. I must find him!" />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_Uluk_FirstTime_1"
		value="The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. The locals gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterSomeTimeTravel"
		value="After many long days of driving under the scorching sun and sandy wind, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the clay buildings of Vahat.|But the people there are strange: one moment they are friendly, the next they are trying to stab you in the back. And the oddest thing is that everyone seems to be occupied with something, but no one can talk coherently about anything. It's as if everyone's memory is faded." />

	<string
		id="r4_KnownAboutBuhara"
		value="I found out that there is a village of the Memory Keepers nearby – that’s what they call their elders. I must go there and find one sane person. I wonder, what happened here… This place looks like it survived a major cataclysm." />

	<string
		id="r4_FindBuhara"
		value="It was with great difficulty that I managed to find a place lost in the desert among the hulks of huge ships, I'll give credit to the caution of its owners. One thing was unclear, why would the old men want to hide?" />

	<string
		id="r4_TalkWithBuhares"
		value="My visit caused panic among Bukhara population. It was only when the Memory Keepers realized that I didn’t mean harm that they told me their grim story:| Many years ago a mysterious madness seized the people of local villages. They started killing each other, and worst of all, they had no memory of what they had done afterwards. Strangely, the plague did not affect the old people of Bukhara, although they lived in constant fear of attack. It came as a shock to me that there were no mysterious villains, but ordinary people were killing each other and destroying their own houses." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterAtackToBuhars"
		value="Now I understood why the elders tried so hard to hide their village. Following me, military vehicles arrived and opened fire on Bukhara from the cannons. I couldn’t let them kill innocent people! I remembered too well what happened to my own village. I fought until we destroyed the last machine and then helped to evacuate the elders on a ship. In return they told me that a man who fit the description of my father had once passed their village. He was looking for something and headed east. I’ll follow him!" />

	<string
		id="r4_LisaBecameCrazy"
		value="There was something strange going on with Lisa the whole journey: first she became nervous, suspicious, and finally turned hysterical right in the cabin of my truck! It was a real test of my humanity. But I realised that it was just the way this place was affecting her mentally.|When we reached the port, she fainted. So I sent her to the mainland with the rest of the townsfolk so Ben could take care of her. I continued my search." />

	<string
		id="r4_FindFatherCar"
		value="I soon found an old armored vehicle covered in sand, apparently damaged during the skirmish. There was no body inside, but I found a jacket with my father’s name on it. He’s been there! Looks like he’s left his truck and continued his journey on foot.| I took a few gadgets from the car – they were too good to be left here. They will remind me of my father. I’m sure I’m on the right way now." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterMilitaryBase"
		value="Nothing prepared me for the encounter with the army of madmen. I was saved from the imminent death by unexpected ally - my old familiar Sergo." />

	<string
		id="r4_NearTarelka"
		value="Crossing the next dune, I saw a terrible sight: many people were standing motionless around a huge metal mountain. I couldn’t say whether they were dead or alive. I didn’t know why they gathered here but I felt, that Ivan Go was one of them. No one answered my cries and signals. A feeling of great sorrow came upon me." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Fight_Aliens"
		value="My eyes are open. Evil alien invaders are terraforming our planet with the help of the huge emitter, I found in the desert. But their main base is somewhere around Seil, a town in the Librium. Its radiation jams the Oracle’s signals. If I destroy the base, my mechanical ally will take control over the orbital weapon and launch nuclear strikes that will stop the invasion for good!" />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Fight_Oracle"
		value="I met one of the aliens, Njeri, as they call themselves. Now I now what really happened in the past. The catastrophe was caused by a chain of tragic incidents that triggered a mechanism that was not designed to operate in the vicinity of living beings. Even the Njeri themselves can't get close enough to it. But I've been there once before and survived, which means I can stop the emitter. And I will do it!" />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterTarelka2"
		value="I could almost feel the power coming from the centre of this circle, calling me to join the majority. I managed to resist it and return to the settlement. Here I learned about the catastrophe that destroyed the ancient world and its causes. Humans should not play with things that are beyond their comprehension! Now the extraterrestrial mechanism, triggered by the Scientist keeps working and poisoning my planet.| I must destroy this place along with its horrors and mysteries. Oracle probably knows where to find a powerful enough weapon." />

	<string
		id="r5_Sklad"
		value="I couldn't find the composite in Midgard, so Ben told me about the Kingdom of Eternal Cold, where Ivan might have been able to obtain this rather rare material. I went again to Hel and found Homer, who, to my surprise, told me that this place really exists. In order to get there, I will need warm clothes, which can only be found in a storage facility taken over by the local fishermen. I would have to solve this problem somehow." />

	<string
		id="r5_SkladRybaki"
		value="After listening to both sides of the conflict, I decided to support the locals and free their leader from the clutches of the northern traders. I attacked their caravan, killed the guards, and rescued the prisoner, after which the fishermen left the storage and Lisa and I got some warm clothes. After blowing the tunnel's blockage, we finally made our way to Lidencloud." />

	<string
		id="r5_SkladTSP"
		value="After listening to both sides of the conflict, I decided to side with the merchants and liberate the storage by force. The cleanup itself was not very difficult, as I was assisted by a considerable military force of the traders. After the fishermen were defeated, Lisa and I picked up some warm clothes, blew up the tunnel blockage, and headed for Lidencloud." />

	<string
		id="r5_LisaKidnapped"
		value="When we arrived in Lidencloud, we immediately encountered a problem: the tunnel exit was blocked, and only Lisa managed to squeeze through a small hole in the wall. After scouting around a bit, she came across some locals who were hiding from the violent invaders - the Red Torch Adepts. She agreed to go to the abandoned village for food, warm clothing, and the key to the gate, but on her way back she was ambushed by the Adepts and captured. Later, the locals opened the gate for me and briefly described the situation. In Kateberg, one of the Adept cities, I was given a choice: fight on the side of the locals and endanger both my life and Lisa's, or join the Adepts and effortlessly defeat the trapped inhabitants of Lidencloud." />

	<string
		id="r5_AdeptWin"
		value="My feelings of remorse were very strong, but I couldn't put Lisa's life in danger, so I agreed to fight on the side of the adepts. I had done many disgusting things, and the ghosts of my past would haunt me for the rest of my life. In the end, together with the Adepts, I exterminated all the locals, and they opened the bridge for me and set Lisa free, but now she doesn't talk to me." />

	<string
		id="r5_LocalsWin"
		value="The decision to fight on the side of the locals was easy enough for me. Of course, I was worried about Lisa's well-being, so I did everything very quietly and carefully, but my fears were in vain: from the very first day in Moska, Lisa developed an escape plan and persuaded a couple of locals to help her, while the Velimir provided quite wise planning and demonstrated an example of sacrifice worthy of respect. Finally the Adepts were defeated, the locals evacuated, and Lisa and I headed further into the mountains." />

	<string
		id="r5_SplavTaken"
		value="Sage Mountains proved to be an amazing place. From the fact that all the people in the region are infinitely kind to outsiders, to their unusual outlook and willingness to forget the past and live only in the present. But sometimes very strange things happen here too, for which I have no explanation yet. In spite of some difficulties, I completed all the tasks of the sages, and they produced the required amount of composite for me." />
